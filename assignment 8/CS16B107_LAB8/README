							DISJOINT SET UNION
					Author: E Santhosh Kumar (CS16B107)
***********************************************************************************

PROBLEM STATEMENT:-					
Implement disjoint set data structure with support for the following operations

1. Make_set ( x ) - To create a new set with element x

2. Find_set ( x ) - Find the set to which x belongs

3. Union (S1, S2) - Union of two sets S1 and S2

Also, provide an interactive interface through the terminal for the above operations. 

***********************************************************************************
COMPILATION COMMAND;-
Compile the code using the following command

	gcc -o assign8 driver.c disjoint_set.c

***********************************************************************************
USING THE PROGRAM:-
The program offers support for the following interactive operations over Disjoint Set Union
	
	1) makeSet -> a function to create a new set with the given element, provided the element is not already present 
	2) findSet -> a function to print the Leader of the set that the given element belongs to, if it is present
	3) unionSet -> a function to perform Union operation on the sets that contain the 2 given elements

	All three functions can be accessed through the interactive menu offered by the driver program
